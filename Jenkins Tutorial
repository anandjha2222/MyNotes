-- java application
-- platform independent
-- used for CICD
-- developed code checked in git, jenkins will take latest cdode and trigger the build, and build notification will be sent to
	team members, so in case of any error, it can be resolved then and there and bug finding will not waste time.
-- As a post build actions we can integrate tests with build in jenkins. Once the build is successful, automatically it will be tested and 
	report will be sent back, so in case any thing unexpected happens due to new changes, it can be rectified immediately.
-- In short, entire build and test process if followed as soon as the code is checked in the repository, hence called continuous integration


Download jenkins
-----------------

--download war file
--place war file anywhere
--cmd->navigate to jenkins war file
--java -jar jenkins.war
--copy admin pass and keep it. (Not needed however)
--4fab8c6681614165a1c1a780e61713c4 (This may also be found at: C:\Users\Anand\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword)
--jenkins run on port 8080
--jenkins comes with stand alone server
--but we can deploy jenkins on other server as well like tomcat
--browser : http://localhost:8080
--give above password
--jenkins will start
--choose 'Select plugins to install' and spend some time identifying what all plugins are and finally install no plugins right now 
--you can create an new admin user or you can just continue as admin. Continue as admin for now.
--visit 'C:\Users\Anand\.jenkins' All jenkins related jobs, logs, nodes, plugins etc will be there

How to setup jenkins on tomcat
------------------------------

Jenkins comes with jetty/winstone (ie stand alone servers) then why we need to setup jenkins on Tomcat ?

--we can start all our applications including jenkins at the same place ie tomcat. However this is not a necessity
--jenkins can be installed on so many containers
	Glassfish
	tomcatjBoss
	WebSphere
	Jetty
	Jonas
	Weblogic
	etc
--java 7 or above and tomcat 5 or above is needed 

--Download tomcat
--unzip it
--copy and place jenkins.war inside tomcat webapps folder
--start tomcat.
--cmd->tomcat bin dir->(make all files executable <for unix> chmod +x *.sh)
--start tomcat : inside bin -> startup.bat
--browser-> http://localhost:8080 (means tomcat is running)
--now access jenkins : http://localhost:8080/jenkins
--admin is user and password is above in the file
--one instance of jenkins is already running inside tomcat, but we can parallely run another instance of jenkins as well but not on port 8080
	as both tomcat and jenkins run on port 8080 by default.
-- In this case run jenkins as below : java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090

Tilll now we have started 2 instances of jenkins
  1. inside Tomcat (8080)
  2. stand alone (9090)
--ctreate a test job using link 'Please create new jobs to get started' in 8080
--just give the name as 'TestJob1' and leave all defaults in the next page

--ctreate a test job using link 'Please create new jobs to get started' in 9090
--just give the name as 'TestJob2' and leave all defaults in the next page

--restart both jenkins instances
--Now you will see both jobs in both jenkins instances <What does this mean ?????>

How to change Home Directory of jenkins
---------------------------------------

By default .jenkins folder is created here 'C:\Users\<user>\.jenkins'. Now we want to change this to another location.
We want to change jenkins Home Directory because of following reasons :
  1. To move jenkins home dir to a location that has enough disk space
  2. project requirement

--check your current home directory : this can be checked from jenkins dashboard
--Go to manage jenkins
--Configure system : you will see this 'Home directory	C:\Users\anand.kumar33\.jenkins' as the 1st line
--create a new folder at desired location which will be new home dir
--copy all data from old dir to new dir (manually)
--change env veriable (JENKINS_HOME) and set to new dir
  1. using control panel->set environment variable
  2. using cmd    set JENKINS_HOME=D:\jenkins home dir
--Restart Jenkins

Using CLI in jenkins
--------------------

Why use CLI when we already have UI

--easire
--faster
--memory management(consumes less memory than UI)
--At time of continuous integration


--start jenkins   java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090
--manage jenkins
--configure global security
--enable security must be checked
--go to http://localhost:8080/cli/ 
--Download jenkins-cli from the same page : "To get started, download jenkins-cli.jar"
--test the cli is working fine : goto where cli jar is 
--java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/
-- in case of issue : Go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security ->
    Enable Security Checked
    Authorization -> Logged-in Users can do anything -> Checked allow anonymous read access
    Restart Jenkins and try running
    java -jar jenkins-cls.jar -s http://localhost:8080

How to create users + manage + assign roles
-------------------------------------------

--how to create new user
--how to configure user
--how to create new roles
--how to assign user to roles
--how to control user access on projects


--start jenkins
--create new user
--manage jenkins > manage users > create user
--configure user : manage jenkins > manage users > configure button in front of user
--Now we will create and manage user roles
    Roles Strategy Plugin - download - restart jenkins
    manage jenkins -> configure global security -> enable security (checked) -> Access Control -> Authorization -> Role Based Strategy
    NOTE : login must be as admin
 --logout from admin user and try to login as User1 , will get error : 'user1 is missing the Overall/Read permission'
 --Now we will grant some access to User1. Login as admin for this
 --Manage Jenkins -> manage and assign roles -> 
      manage roles
      assign roles
      role strategy macros
 --manage roles first <play around with site , will get to know>
 --assign roles to users <play around with site , will get to know>
