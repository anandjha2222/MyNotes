Tilll now we have started 2 instances of jenkins
  1. inside Tomcat (8080)
  2. stand alone (9090)
--ctreate a test job using link 'Please create new jobs to get started' in 8080
--just give the name as 'TestJob1' and leave all defaults in the next page

--ctreate a test job using link 'Please create new jobs to get started' in 9090
--just give the name as 'TestJob2' and leave all defaults in the next page

--restart both jenkins instances
--Now you will see both jobs in both jenkins instances <What does this mean ?????>
