Tilll now we have started 2 instances of jenkins
  1. inside Tomcat (8080)
  2. stand alone (9090)
--ctreate a test job using link 'Please create new jobs to get started' in 8080
--just give the name as 'TestJob1' and leave all defaults in the next page

--ctreate a test job using link 'Please create new jobs to get started' in 9090
--just give the name as 'TestJob2' and leave all defaults in the next page

--restart both jenkins instances
--Now you will see both jobs in both jenkins instances <What does this mean ?????>

How to change Home Directory of jenkins
---------------------------------------

By default .jenkins folder is created here 'C:\Users\<user>\.jenkins'. Now we want to change this to another location.
We want to change jenkins Home Directory because of following reasons :
  1. To move jenkins home dir to a location that has enough disk space
  2. project requirement

--check your current home directory : this can be checked from jenkins dashboard
--Go to manage jenkins
--Configure system : you will see this 'Home directory	C:\Users\anand.kumar33\.jenkins' as the 1st line
--create a new folder at desired location which will be new home dir
--copy all data from old dir to new dir (manually)
--change env veriable (JENKINS_HOME) and set to new dir
  1. using control panel->set environment variable
  2. using cmd    set JENKINS_HOME=D:\jenkins home dir
--Restart Jenkins

Using CLI in jenkins
--------------------

Why use CLI when we already have UI

--easire
--faster
--memory management(consumes less memory than UI)
--At time of continuous integration


--start jenkins   java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090
--manage jenkins
--configure global security
--enable security must be checked
--go to http://localhost:8080/cli/ 
--Download jenkins-cli from the same page : "To get started, download jenkins-cli.jar"
--test the cli is working fine : goto where cli jar is 
--java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/
-- in case of issue : Go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security ->
    Enable Security Checked
    Authorization -> Logged-in Users can do anything -> Checked allow anonymous read access
    Restart Jenkins and try running
    java -jar jenkins-cls.jar -s http://localhost:8080
