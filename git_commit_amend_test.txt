If you want to change commit messag after push into the branch:

(1) git commit --amend -m "Correct commit messsage"
(2) git push origin --force

this worked but commit id got changed

If you want to persist same commit ID
______________________________________

find out the commit id of one previous commit whose commit message you want to change
eg : 8151a5f92b602b7978719c9cce98d9b39b2f7cf4
<I want to change message of commit id 1fd38ccb5c386378006fdc9aad726b27e079afdb>
git rebase -i 8151a5f92b602b7978719c9cce98d9b39b2f7cf4
<this command will open a text editor which will list out all commits after this commit_id>
c

ange "pick" to "reword" first the :wq
It will open another editor , there you can change your commit message
Rest process will be same

NOTE : commit id will be changed in this case as well

this worked
