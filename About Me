Hi, I started my career in july 2014 from Cognizant Technology Solutions. After successful complition of corporate training I got deployed
in Metlife-Ariba project, where I worked as java developer. As part of this project I got opportunity to work on all phases of SDLC. 
Initially, my role was to replicate the code for file generation for UpStream and DownStream systems abriba users. For example, writing 
code for Europe with some major and/or minor changes(as per business requirement) with regards to US. This used to be a long assignment 
for me which usually took 3 months to deploy code in Production. In this fashion I did almost 7 successful deployment. With this continuous
tasks, being junior resource, I was taking care of day to day tasks of manual user/supervisor/group/access-assignment load in ariba system,
as the code development was the continuous process and some very important new users were to onboarded on urgent basis. For a simple example
- For new user on-board, I needed to create 5 csv files manually and upload in ariba with online portal. This task was a time consuming 
task and some-times error-prone. So, I wrote excel macro to create these files based on a single key(id of new user) provided by client with
help of GLOBAL HR CSV file. This automation drastically reduced my manual effor and correctness of load process increased for which I got
appriciation from my On-Site manager and team. Also, I shared This macro with my team and prepared hand-over document for the same so that
new member of the team get benefited.
   As a result of automation I had time to work on other stuff as well, so I took part in 
   
   //Need to mention, which tools I used while development.
